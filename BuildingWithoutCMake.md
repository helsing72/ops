# Building without CMake #
## Build opsc (command-line OPS IDL compiler) and OPS Core for Java on Windows ##
Run the bat-file 'OPS_DIR\Script\Build_Idl_Compiler.bat'. This will compile the necessary Java libraries, including *OPS Core for Java*, and the opsc compiler.

The result will be in "OPS_DIR\Tools\opsc\dist".

The opsc compiler can then be used like:
> OPS_DIR\Tools\opsc\opsc.bat -h

## Build OPS Core for C++ with Visual Studio ##
Open the solution/project for your version of Visual Studio (has been used with
VS2008, VS2010, VS2012, VS2013 and VS2015) in directory

> "OPS\_DIR\Cpp\Visual C++\OPSCrossPlatformCppSolution_20xx\OPSCrossPlatformCppLib_20xx.sln"

Check that the include and library references to boost corresponds with your installation (see Visual Studio project properties).

Build the solution for all configurations (both x86 and x64):

  * "Debug" - for compiler setting Multi-threaded Debug
  * "Debug DLL" - for compiler setting Multi-threaded Debug DLL
  * "Release" - for compiler setting Multi-threaded Release
  * "Release DLL" - for compiler setting Multi-threaded Release DLL

Verify they all compile alright (you will have some warnings).

## Building OPS Core for C# with Visual Studio ##

> "OPS_DIR\CSharp\Projects\OpsLibrary\OpsLibrary.sln"

Build the solution for all configurations:

  * "Debug" - for compiler setting Debug
  * "Release" - for compiler setting Release
