# Remaining Issues #

OPS is far from complete. Remaining Issues and shortcomings include:

  * Documentation is Poor, there is no API docs
  * TCP Transport only allow on publisher per Topic
  * OPS has no active community (it is maintained by one person only at the time being)
  * OPS needs more users
  * Java Performance could improve, it is now suffering a bit from C++ optimizations, this is especially true for large messages.

To solve these and other issues and make OPS better, help is required. Please file Issue reports and send in Patches.
